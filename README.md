# A-Maps
With the A-Maps plugin for QGIS you will be able to consume Azure Maps services with your Azure Maps subscription.

The plugin consists of a GUI to handle your credentials and a set of processing algorithms in the processing toolbox.
Prior usage, please make sure, that your credentials are listed in the GUI by getting a key from Azure (we are using the "Primary Key") and adding to the plugin:<br>
